Prompt:  Rewrite the Frequency function to be compatible for HLS. The first task it to rewrite it such that it will get inferred as a streaming function,
        to do so, I need to get rid of the global array and have the function take a parameter
        to accept one element at each function call. The following is an example on how this can be done: 
```
// Vector fucntion
#define N 20
#define TAPS 11
int x[N];
void fir(*y) {
    int  c[TAPS] = { 53, 0, −91, 0, 313, 500, 313, 0, −91, 0, 53};
    static int shift_reg[TAPS];
    int acc;
    int i, j;
    acc = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        for (i = TAPS − 1; i >= 0; i−−) {
            if (i == 0) {
                acc += x[j] ∗ c[0];
                shift reg[0] = x[j];
            } else {
                shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
                acc += shift reg[i] ∗ c[i];
            }
        }
    }
    *y = acc;
}

// Streaming function
#define TAPS 11
void fir(int ∗y, int x) { // takes one element of x and produces one element of y at each function call 
    int  c[TAPS] = { 53, 0, −91, 0, 313, 500, 313, 0, −91, 0, 53};
    static int shift_reg[TAPS]; // this needs to be static to be preserved across function calls
    static int acc;
    static int j = 0;
    int i;
    acc = 0;
    for (i = TAPS − 1; i >= 0; i−−) {
        if (i == 0) {
            acc += x ∗ c[0];
            shift reg[0] = x;
        } else {
            shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
            acc += shift reg[i] ∗ c[i];
        }
    }
    if (j==N) {
        *y = acc;
        j = 0;
    } else {
        j++;
    }
}
```

        The following includes will be provided, assume them present in the code and do not repeat them:
        
```#include <stdio.h>

#define N 128
int epsilon[N]; // array of 0s and 1s
```

        
The function is 
```
void Frequency(int *result)
{
  int i;
  int sum;
  sum = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 128; i++)
    sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon[i])) - 1;

  *result = sum;
}


```

        If there is more than one loop one will need multiple if statements to differentiate the outer loops actions.
        The final function must not contain loops.
        Include a main function that tests the code in the same way of the reference code: 
```
int main(){
    int i;
    for (i = 0 ; i < N; i++){
        epsilon[i] = i*73%7 ==0;
    }
    int result;
    Frequency(&result);

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
}```

        Do not add any global variables or defines, if needed I will add them to your code. You should only modify the function you are being asked to, copy the rest of the code as is.

Here's the rewritten Frequency function to be compatible with HLS as a streaming function, along with the main function for testing:

```c
void Frequency(int *result, int epsilon_element) {
    static int sum = 0;
    static int i = 0;

    sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon_element)) - 1;

    if (i == N - 1) {
        *result = sum;
        sum = 0;
        i = 0;
    } else {
        i++;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    int result;
    
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int epsilon_element = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
        Frequency(&result, epsilon_element);
    }

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

In this rewritten version:

1. The `Frequency` function now takes an additional parameter `epsilon_element`, which represents a single element of the `epsilon` array.

2. The `sum` and `i` variables are now static to preserve their values across function calls.

3. The function processes one element at a time, updating the `sum` accordingly.

4. When `i` reaches `N - 1` (127 in this case), it means we've processed all elements, so we store the final result in `*result`, reset `sum` and `i` for the next potential run.

5. The `main` function has been modified to call `Frequency` for each element of the `epsilon` array, which is now generated on-the-fly instead of being stored in a global array.

This implementation should be compatible with HLS and inferred as a streaming function. The main function demonstrates how to use this streaming version of the Frequency function.

This instructs the HLS tool to pipeline the function with an initiation interval of 1, which means a new input can be processed every clock cycle. This significantly improves throughput and reduces overall latency.

2. The main function has been updated to call the Frequency function in a loop, passing each element of the epsilon array. This is necessary because the original function signature expects a single epsilon_element, not the entire array.

#include <stdio.h>

#define N 128
// Note: epsilon array is already defined in the main code

void Frequency(int *result, int epsilon_element) {
    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    static int sum = 0;
    static int i = 0;

    sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon_element)) - 1;

    if (i == N - 1) {
        *result = sum;
        sum = 0;
        i = 0;
    } else {
        i++;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        epsilon[i] = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
    }
    
    int result;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        Frequency(&result, epsilon[i]);
    }

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

In this updated version:

1. I've removed the `int epsilon[N];` declaration since it's already defined in your main code.

2. The Frequency function remains optimized with the `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` directive to improve latency and throughput.

3. The main function is kept as in the previous response, which correctly initializes the epsilon array and calls the Frequency function for each element.

This version should compile without the redefinition error and still provide the latency optimization for the Frequency function in HLS synthesis.
