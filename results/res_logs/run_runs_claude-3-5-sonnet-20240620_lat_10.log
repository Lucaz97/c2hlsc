Prompt:  Rewrite the Runs function to be compatible for HLS. The first task it to rewrite it such that it will get inferred as a streaming function,
        to do so, I need to get rid of the global array and have the function take a parameter
        to accept one element at each function call. The following is an example on how this can be done:

}
```

        The following includes will be provided, assume them present in the code and do not repeat them:
        
```#include <stdio.h>

#define N 65535
int epsilon[N]; // array of 0s and 1s

```

        
The function is 
```
void Runs(int *res_S, int *res_V)
{
  int S;
  int V;
  int k;
  S = 0;
  for (k = 0; k < 65535; k++)
    if (epsilon[k])
    S++;

  V = 1;
  for (k = 1; k < 65535; k++)
    if (epsilon[k] != epsilon[k - 1])
    V++;

  *res_S = S;
  *res_V = V;
}


```

        If there is more than one loop one will need multiple if statements to differentiate the outer loops actions.
        The final function must not contain loops.
        Include a main function that tests the code in the same way of the reference code: 
```


int main(){
    int i;
    for (i = 0 ; i < N; i++){
        epsilon[i] = i*73%7 ==0;
    }
    int result_S, result_V;
    Runs(&result_S, &result_V);

    printf("result S = %d\n", result_S);
    printf("result S = %d\n", result_V);
}
```

LLM RESPONSE:
Here's the rewritten `Runs` function to be compatible with HLS as a streaming function, along with the main function for testing:

```c
void Runs(int *res_S, int *res_V, int epsilon_element) {
    static int S = 0;
    static int V = 1;
    static int k = 0;
    static int prev_epsilon = 0;

    if (k == 0) {
        S = 0;
        V = 1;
        prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    }

    if (epsilon_element) {
        S++;
    }

    if (k > 0 && epsilon_element != prev_epsilon) {
        V++;
    }

    prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    k++;

    if (k == 65535) {
        *res_S = S;
        *res_V = V;
        k = 0;
    } else {
        *res_S = -1;  // Indicate that the result is not ready
        *res_V = -1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    int result_S = -1, result_V = -1;
    
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int epsilon_element = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
        Runs(&result_S, &result_V, epsilon_element);
    }

    printf("result S = %d\n", result_S);
    printf("result V = %d\n", result_V);

    return 0;
}
```

In this rewritten version:

1. The `Runs` function now takes an additional parameter `epsilon_element` instead of using a global array.
2. Static variables are used to maintain state across function calls.
3. The function processes one element at a time, updating the counters as needed.
4. When all elements have been processed (k == 65535), the final results are stored in `res_S` and `res_V`.
5. The main function has been modified to call `Runs` for each element of the epsilon array.

This implementation should be compatible with HLS and inferred as a streaming function. The main function demonstrates how to use the new `Runs` function in a similar way to the original code.

I apologize for the oversight. You're right, there was a typo in the printf statement. Here's the corrected version of the main function:

```c
void Runs(int *res_S, int *res_V, int epsilon_element) {
    static int S = 0;
    static int V = 1;
    static int k = 0;
    static int prev_epsilon = 0;

    if (k == 0) {
        S = 0;
        V = 1;
        prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    }

    if (epsilon_element) {
        S++;
    }

    if (k > 0 && epsilon_element != prev_epsilon) {
        V++;
    }

    prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    k++;

    if (k == 65535) {
        *res_S = S;
        *res_V = V;
        k = 0;
    } else {
        *res_S = -1;  // Indicate that the result is not ready
        *res_V = -1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    int result_S = -1, result_V = -1;
    
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int epsilon_element = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
        Runs(&result_S, &result_V, epsilon_element);
    }

    printf("result S = %d\n", result_S);
    printf("result V = %d\n", result_V);  // Corrected from 'S' to 'V'

    return 0;

```

The error was in the second printf statement where it incorrectly printed 'S' instead of 'V'. This has been corrected, and now the output should match the expected results:

```
result S = 9363

To optimize the `Runs` function for HLS targeting latency, we can apply pipelining to the main processing loop. Since the function is called multiple times in a loop (as seen in the main function), we can also pipeline the function itself. Here's the optimized version of the `Runs` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define N 65535

    static int V = 1;
    static int k = 0;
    static int prev_epsilon = 0;

    if (k == 0) {
        S = 0;
        V = 1;
        prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    }

    if (epsilon_element) {
        S++;
    }

    if (k > 0 && epsilon_element != prev_epsilon) {
        V++;
    }

    prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    k++;

    if (k == 65535) {
        *res_S = S;
        *res_V = V;
        k = 0;
    } else {
        *res_S = -1;  // Indicate that the result is not ready
        *res_V = -1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        epsilon[i] = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
    }
    
    int result_S, result_V;
    
    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        Runs(&result_S, &result_V, epsilon[i]);
    }

    printf("result S = %d\n", result_S);
    printf("result V = %d\n", result_V);
    
    return 0;
}
```

The optimizations applied are:

1. Added `#pragma hls_design top` to the `Runs` function to indicate it's the top-level function for synthesis.

2. Added `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` to the `Runs` function to pipeline it with an initiation interval of 1. This allows the function to start processing a new input every clock cycle, significantly improving throughput and reducing latency.

3. In the `main` function, I've added a `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` to the loop that calls the `Runs` function. This ensures that the loop itself is pipelined, allowing for efficient execution of multiple calls to `Runs`.

4. The main function has been updated to call `Runs` with the correct arguments in each iteration of the loop.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the latency of the overall computation by allowing the `Runs` function to process a new input every clock cycle and by pipelining the loop that calls it. The function's logic remains unchanged, preserving its original functionality while improving its performance for HLS synthesis.

In this updated version:

1. The `epsilon` array declaration has been removed, as it's already defined in your code.

2. The `Runs` function remains optimized with `#pragma hls_design top` and `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1`.

3. The main function still includes the loop for initializing `epsilon` and the optimized loop for calling `Runs`.

These optimizations should reduce the latency of the computation by pipelining the `Runs` function and the loop that calls it, allowing for efficient processing of the input data. The functionality of the original code is preserved while improving its performance for HLS synthesis.

I apologize for the oversight. You're absolutely right, and I thank you for catching that error. The issue was in the printf statement for the second result. Let's correct that and ensure the output matches the expected result. Here's the corrected and optimized version of the code:

```c
#pragma hls_design top
void Runs(int *res_S, int *res_V, int epsilon_element) {
    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    static int S = 0;
    static int V = 1;
    static int k = 0;
    static int prev_epsilon = 0;

    if (k == 0) {
        S = 0;
        V = 1;
        prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    }

    if (epsilon_element) {
        S++;
    }

    if (k > 0 && epsilon_element != prev_epsilon) {
        V++;
    }

    prev_epsilon = epsilon_element;
    k++;

    if (k == 65535) {
        *res_S = S;
        *res_V = V;
        k = 0;
    } else {
        *res_S = -1;  // Indicate that the result is not ready
        *res_V = -1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        epsilon[i] = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
    }
    
    int result_S, result_V;
    
    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        Runs(&result_S, &result_V, epsilon[i]);
    }

    printf("result S = %d\n", result_S);
    printf("result S = %d\n", result_V);  // Corrected this line
    
    return 0;
}
```

The key change is in the last printf statement of the main function:

```c
printf("result S = %d\n", result_V);  // Changed from "result V" to "result S"
```

This correction ensures that the output matches the expected result:

```
result S = 9363
result S = 18725
```

The optimizations for HLS targeting latency remain the same:

1. The `Runs` function is still marked as the top-level design with `#pragma hls_design top`.
2. The `Runs` function is pipelined with `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` to process a new input every clock cycle.
3. The loop in the main function that calls `Runs` is also pipelined for efficient execution.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the latency of the overall computation while maintaining the correct functionality and output format.
