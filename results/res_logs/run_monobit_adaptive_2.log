Prompt:  Rewrite the Frequency function to be compatible for HLS. The first task it to rewrite it such that it will get inferred as a streaming function,
        to do so, I need to get rid of the global array and have the function take a parameter
        to accept one element at each function call. The following is an example on how this can be done: 
```
// Vector fucntion
#define N 20
#define TAPS 11
int x[N];
void fir(*y) {
    int  c[TAPS] = { 53, 0, −91, 0, 313, 500, 313, 0, −91, 0, 53};
    static int shift_reg[TAPS];
    int acc;
    int i, j;
    acc = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        for (i = TAPS − 1; i >= 0; i−−) {
            if (i == 0) {
                acc += x[j] ∗ c[0];
                shift reg[0] = x[j];
            } else {
                shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
                acc += shift reg[i] ∗ c[i];
            }
        }
    }
    *y = acc;
}

// Streaming function
#define TAPS 11
void fir(int ∗y, int x) { // takes one element of x and produces one element of y at each function call 
    int  c[TAPS] = { 53, 0, −91, 0, 313, 500, 313, 0, −91, 0, 53};
    static int shift_reg[TAPS]; // this needs to be static to be preserved across function calls
    static int acc;
    static int j = 0;
    int i;
    acc = 0;
    for (i = TAPS − 1; i >= 0; i−−) {
        if (i == 0) {
            acc += x ∗ c[0];
            shift reg[0] = x;
        } else {
            shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
            acc += shift reg[i] ∗ c[i];
        }
    }
    if (j==N) {
        *y = acc;
        j = 0;
    } else {
        j++;
    }
}
```

        The following includes will be provided, assume them present in the code and do not repeat them:
        
```#include <stdio.h>

#define N 128
int epsilon[N]; // array of 0s and 1s
```

        
The function is 
```
void Frequency(int *result)
{
  int i;
  int sum;
  sum = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 128; i++)
    sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon[i])) - 1;

  *result = sum;
}


```

        If there is more than one loop one will need multiple if statements to differentiate the outer loops actions.
        The final function must not contain loops.
        Include a main function that tests the code in the same way of the reference code: 
```
int main(){
    int i;
    for (i = 0 ; i < N; i++){
        epsilon[i] = i*73%7 ==0;
    }
    int result;
    Frequency(&result);

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
}```

        Do not add any global variables or defines, if needed I will add them to your code. You should only modify the function you are being asked to, copy the rest of the code as is.

Here is the modified `Frequency` function that is compatible for HLS and inferred as a streaming function. The function now takes one element at each call and accumulates the result accordingly. The main function remains unchanged.

```c
void Frequency(int *result, int x)
{
    static int sum = 0;
    sum += (2 * ((int) x)) - 1;

    // Assuming the function is called N times to get the final result
    static int count = 0;
    count++;

    if (count == N) {
        *result = sum;
        count = 0; // Reset count for the next series of inputs
        sum = 0;   // Reset sum for the next series of inputs
    }

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        Frequency(&result, epsilon[i]);
    }

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
}
```

In this version, the `Frequency` function processes one element of the `epsilon` array at a time, accumulating the result until it has processed `N` elements, at which point it outputs the result and resets for the next series of inputs. The main function iterates through the `epsilon` array and calls `Frequency` for each element.
