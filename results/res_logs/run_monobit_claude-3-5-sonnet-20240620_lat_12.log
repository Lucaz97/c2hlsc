Prompt:  Rewrite the Frequency function to be compatible for HLS. The first task it to rewrite it such that it will get inferred as a streaming function,
        to do so, I need to get rid of the global array and have the function take a parameter
        to accept one element at each function call. The following is an example on how this can be done: 
```
// Vector fucntion
#define N 20
#define TAPS 11
int x[N];
void fir(*y) {
    int  c[TAPS] = { 53, 0, −91, 0, 313, 500, 313, 0, −91, 0, 53};
    static int shift_reg[TAPS];
    int acc;
    int i, j;
    acc = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        for (i = TAPS − 1; i >= 0; i−−) {
            if (i == 0) {
                acc += x[j] ∗ c[0];
                shift reg[0] = x[j];
            } else {
                shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
                acc += shift reg[i] ∗ c[i];
            }
        }
    }
    *y = acc;
}

// Streaming function
#define TAPS 11
void fir(int ∗y, int x) { // takes one element of x and produces one element of y at each function call 
    int  c[TAPS] = { 53, 0, −91, 0, 313, 500, 313, 0, −91, 0, 53};

    int i;
    acc = 0;
    for (i = TAPS − 1; i >= 0; i−−) {
        if (i == 0) {
            acc += x ∗ c[0];
            shift reg[0] = x;
        } else {
            shift reg[i] = shift reg[i − 1];
            acc += shift reg[i] ∗ c[i];
        }
    }
    if (j==N) {
        *y = acc;
        j = 0;
    } else {
        j++;
    }
}
```

        The following includes will be provided, assume them present in the code and do not repeat them:
        
```#include <stdio.h>

#define N 128
int epsilon[N]; // array of 0s and 1s
```

        
The function is 
```
void Frequency(int *result)
{
  int i;
  int sum;
  sum = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 128; i++)
    sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon[i])) - 1;

  *result = sum;
}


```

        If there is more than one loop one will need multiple if statements to differentiate the outer loops actions.
        The final function must not contain loops.
        Include a main function that tests the code in the same way of the reference code: 
```
int main(){
    int i;
    for (i = 0 ; i < N; i++){
        epsilon[i] = i*73%7 ==0;
    }
    int result;
    Frequency(&result);

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
}```

        Do not add any global variables or defines, if needed I will add them to your code. You should only modify the function you are being asked to, copy the rest of the code as is.

Here's the rewritten Frequency function to be compatible with HLS as a streaming function, along with the main function for testing:

```c
void Frequency(int *result, int epsilon_element) {
    static int sum = 0;
    static int i = 0;

    sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon_element)) - 1;

    if (i == N - 1) {
        *result = sum;
        sum = 0;
        i = 0;
    } else {
        i++;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    int result;
    
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int epsilon_element = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
        Frequency(&result, epsilon_element);
    }

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

In this rewritten version:

1. The `Frequency` function now takes an additional parameter `epsilon_element`, which represents a single element of the `epsilon` array.

2. The `sum` and `i` variables are now static to preserve their values across function calls.

3. The function processes one element at a time, updating the `sum` accordingly.

4. An `if` statement is used to check if we've processed all N elements. If so, it stores the final result, resets the `sum` and `i`, and prepares for the next set of inputs.

5. The `main` function has been modified to call `Frequency` for each element of the `epsilon` array, which is now generated on-the-fly instead of being stored in a global array.

This implementation should be compatible with HLS and inferred as a streaming function. The main function demonstrates how to use this new streaming version of the Frequency function.

LLM RESPONSE:
To optimize the Frequency function for latency in HLS, we can apply pipelining to improve throughput. Here's the optimized version of the function along with the main function for testing:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define N 128
int epsilon[N]; // array of 0s and 1s

#pragma hls_design top
void Frequency(int *result) {
    static int sum = 0;
    static int i = 0;

    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        int epsilon_element = epsilon[j];
        sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon_element)) - 1;

        if (j == N - 1) {
            *result = sum;
            sum = 0;
            i = 0;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        epsilon[i] = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
    }
    int result;
    Frequency(&result);

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

In this optimized version, we've made the following changes:

1. We've moved the loop inside the Frequency function to process all N elements in a single function call. This allows us to apply pipelining to the entire processing loop.

2. We've added the `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` directive to pipeline the loop with an initiation interval of 1. This means that a new iteration of the loop can start every clock cycle, significantly improving throughput and reducing latency.

3. We've added the `#pragma hls_design top` directive to indicate that this is the top-level function for HLS synthesis.

4. We've modified the function signature to remove the `epsilon_element` parameter, as we're now accessing the `epsilon` array directly inside the function.

5. The main function has been updated to call `Frequency(&result)` without passing individual epsilon elements.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the latency of the Frequency function when synthesized for HLS. The pipelining allows for parallel processing of the input elements, which can greatly improve performance compared to the original sequential version.

LLM RESPONSE:
I apologize for the oversight. You're right, the `epsilon` array is already defined in your code. Let's remove that redundant declaration and optimize the Frequency function. Here's the corrected and optimized version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define N 128
// Note: epsilon array is already defined externally

#pragma hls_design top
void Frequency(int *result) {
    static int sum = 0;
    static int i = 0;

    #pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        int epsilon_element = epsilon[j];
        sum += (2 * ((int) epsilon_element)) - 1;

        if (j == N - 1) {
            *result = sum;
            sum = 0;
            i = 0;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        epsilon[i] = i * 73 % 7 == 0;
    }
    int result;
    Frequency(&result);

    printf("result = %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. We've removed the redundant declaration of the `epsilon` array.
2. The rest of the optimizations remain the same as in the previous response:
   - The loop is now inside the Frequency function to process all N elements in a single call.
   - We've applied pipelining with `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval 1` to optimize for latency.
   - The `#pragma hls_design top` directive is used to indicate the top-level function for HLS synthesis.
   - The function signature has been updated to remove the `epsilon_element` parameter.

These changes should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the latency optimizations for HLS synthesis.
